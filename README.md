# The Organization:

Voices of Consent is a nonprofit organization whose goal is to support survivors after a traumatic experience. Locally based, this nonprofit operates in 42 states to help survivors. In the aftermath of a traumatic event, Voices of Consent sends a box to a survivor who requests one.

Survivor Boxes are personalized packages put together to let survivors know they are not alone after an event, that include resources to use as survivors begin the recovery process (including information about laws in their state, free health and counseling services in their area).

Voices of Consent gets the word out to survivors by talking at schools and churches. The boxes are sent to survivors who request them directly, or can be picked up at hospitals or police stations.

We've started a few reference documents based on questions we've been asked. Check out the /notes folder in the repo, and please ask questions in the Ruby for Good Slack or on Github so we can improve our references.

# Setting Up Development

This is a Ruby on Rails 5.2 application with React + Webpack included.

To get started developing on your machine, you'll need the following tools installed:

* ruby 2.6
* node 10+
* yarn 1.16+
* bundler 2+

Some choices for how to run services in your development environment:
* [Heroku Command Line Interface](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/command-line)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to use the docker-compose steps or you will need to install these services individually on your development host:
    * Redis 4+
    * PostgreSQL 9.5+
    * Mailcatcher 0.7.1

## Running the App!

First, set up Local Services (Via Docker or individually installed services as described in the **Starting Local Services** section below.).

Then to run the app locally,

```
$ bundle install
$ yarn install
$ rake dev:setup
$ heroku local -f Procfile.dev
# If you chose the Docker route:
  $ docker-compose start -or- $ docker-compose up
# Else
  $ rails s
$ rspec (to run the test suite)
```

## Starting Local Services

### ... with Docker!

If you opted to install Docker Desktop, `docker-compose start` will run dependency services like PostgreSQL (the database), Redis (the job queue), and Mailcatcher (a fake SMTP mail server for testing). Services will run in the background. NOTE: these services will attempt to use some commonly used ports (e.g. 5432 for PostgreSQL) on localhost, so if you see errors about conflicting ports, you may have the corresponding service already running elsewhere on your development host.

```
$ docker-compose start
Starting db          ... done
Starting cache       ... done
Starting mailcatcher ... done

$ docker-compose ps
             Name                            Command               State                                 Ports
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
voices-of-consent_cache_1         docker-entrypoint.sh redis ...   Up      127.0.0.1:6379->6379/tcp
voices-of-consent_db_1            docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      127.0.0.1:5432->5432/tcp
voices-of-consent_mailcatcher_1   mailcatcher --foreground - ...   Up      127.0.0.1:1025->1025/tcp, 127.0.0.1:1080->1080/tcp, 25/tcp, 80/tcp
```

Stop the services with `docker-compose stop`.

```
$ docker-compose stop
Stopping voices-of-consent_mailcatcher_1 ... done
Stopping voices-of-consent_db_1          ... done
Stopping voices-of-consent_cache_1       ... done
```

If you prefer to keep an eye on what these background services are doing (or whether they're up!), you can run `docker-compose up` instead of `start` to keep the processes in the foreground. You will need to dedicate a terminal window to this display and continue working on the project in a new terminal session. Stop the services with CTRL-C in the terminal they are running in.

```
$ docker-compose up
Starting voices-of-consent_db_1          ... done
Starting voices-of-consent_cache_1       ... done
Starting voices-of-consent_mailcatcher_1 ... done

### ... with individually installed services

Ensure Redis is running. `brew services start redis` on macOS or `redis-server` to run it as a one-off process.

Ensure Postgres is running. We recommend Postgres.app for macOS if you don't already have it installed.

Mailcatcher cannot be bundled, for that reason we must use:

```
$ gem install mailcatcher
```

To get the MailCatcher gem's mail server up run:

```
$ mailcatcher
Go to http://localhost:1080/
Send mail through smtp://localhost:1025
```

You only need this if you're interested in working on emails in the development environment.
